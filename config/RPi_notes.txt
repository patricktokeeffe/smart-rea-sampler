Raspberry Pi configuration notes
================================

config.txt
----------

* Default user name is "pi" and password is "raspberry" -- root account is 
  disabled so use 'sudo' or 'gksu' when necessary

The suggested `config.txt` was sourced from Adafruit, the vendor.

Real-time clock (RTC) construction
----------------------------------

* Omit the resistors so the module communicates at 3.3V instead of 5V
* Fortuitously all signals are adjacent in the ribbon cable:
    * Pin 3: SDA1
    * Pin 4: 5V
    * Pin 5: SCL1
    * Pin 6: Ground
* Cut cable and split apart so pins 1 & 2 constitute one 'cable' (will be used
  for comms w/ Tri-meter), pins 3-6 are connected as another 'cable' and
  remainder of ribbon cable is left alone for now
* To faciliate easy connect/disconnect, use 4-pc PCB-mount screw terminal block
* Mount on one end of small rectangular IC-style RadioShack PCB; other end will
  be used to mount components for communicating with Trimetric


Initial setup
-------------

For initial setup, connection to internet is required to pull updates and
packages. At WSU, need wifi dongle since wired LAN implements MAC filtering.

* Default local is Great Britain, which does funny things to keyboard layout so
  change to US locale
* Enable I2C support for real-time clock comms (two-part process)

* Run `$ sudo raspi-config` 
    * Under (4) Internationalisation
        * change local from 'en_GB UTF8' to 'en_US UTF8'
        * change timezone to 'US > Pacific-New'
        * change keyboard layout from 'English (UK)' to 'Other > English (US) > English (US)'
            * leave AltGr as default for layout
            * no compose key
            * yes, enable Ctrl+Alt+Bckspc to exit X server
    * Under (8) Advanced Options
        * A6 I2C: change from 'no' to 'yes'
        * ???? possibly disable serial output during boot? <-- depends on
          whether UART0 is used to communicate with TriMetric or other UART is
          appropriated
* Follow Adafruit GPIO setup instructions to finish enabling I2C support
* Follow Adafruit Adding a RTC tutorial to finish integrating RTC w/ RPi

RS-232 interfacing
------------------

* USB-RS232 converter (Adafruit product 18, discontinued) operates at +/-10Vdc
  which makes it ideal for use with True RS-232 on Inverter's serial dongle
  but NOT okay for communicating via built-in UARTs -- get serial debug cable
  (Adafruit product 954) instead
