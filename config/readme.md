* GPS :: If the Garmin GPS16x-HVS was not purchased from Campbell Scientific, 
  it must undergo a one-time configuration for use with the datalogger. The
  software required is available for free (see `gps_software_links.txt`) and
  the required settings are saved to an importable format (`gps_settings.cfg').
