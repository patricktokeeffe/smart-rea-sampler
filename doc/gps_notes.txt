- Garmin GPS was purchased from Amazon.com and did not come configured for use
  with CR3000 datalogger
- Connect GPS to computer using RS-232/USB converter, 12Vdc adapter and a
  device built previously but not well documented --> TODO
- Begin communication with GPS using "SNSRXCFG.exe" (v2.90)
    * autodetected device at 4800 baud
    * changed settings:
        ~ baud rate 4800 --> 38400
        ~ disable 'Position averaging' (position pinning = averaging per communication w/ CSI)
    * disabled GPGSA, GPGSV, PGRMT; leaves only GPGGA, GPRMC
    * saved new target settings to 'SNSRXCFG.cfg'
    * sent new settings to device
- Tested, confirmed to work with CR3000
- Remove violet, green wires and tin remaining wires
