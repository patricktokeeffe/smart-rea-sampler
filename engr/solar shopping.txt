power requirements
------------------

Estimated system use of 93W
Pullman area is rated 4hr/day full sun exposure so need 93W*(24/4) = 558W daily input or 4x 140W panels
Using more conservative 100W of use, 100*24/4 = 600W or 4x 150W panels

solar panels, qty 4?
  - Solarland USA; model SPL150S-12; item# 9433286; $275 ea; 59" x 27"; 150W; 8.34A @ 18V; MC4 cables
  - Kyocera; KD140SX-UFBS; item# 1131401; $300 ea; 59" x 26"; 140W; 7.91A @ 17.7V; raw junction box
  - Kyocera; KD140GX-LFBS; item# 1131402; $295 ea; 59" x 26"; 140W; 7.91A @ 17.7V; MC4 cables
  - Solarworld 275; item# 1922275?
  - Astronergy 305; item# 1977305?
  *** using multiple 140W+ panels results in exceeding Amp capacity of current (10A) solar controller! see options below

solar panel cable, qty 1
  - must be sufficiently long to cover double the distance; will cut cable in halff
  - 50' extension cable; 10 AWG; p/n 9994165; $45
  - 100' extension cable; 10 AWG; p/n 9991054; $80
  * may need to increase wire gage significantly (possibly 2 or 1/0 AWG); see (Tristar PWM) controller manual
  * alternately, connect panels locally & run THHN or similar wire (think Romex)

solar panel cable Y-connector, qty (1 each)*(# panels - 1) --> 2 ea?
  - MC4 branch connector, 2 male -> 1 female; p/n 9999404; $21
  - MC4 branch connector, 2 female -> 1 male; p/n 9999403; $21

copper grounding wire (Home Depot)
  - Cerrowire 25ft 6/1 solid bare copper grounding wire; $19.97
  - Southwire 6 solid bare copper; $0.89/ft

some notes
----------
* charge controller must be protected from inductive loads
  - power pump from battery bank using relay on load side
  - place very large flyback diode across load terminals
* may need a breaker ("overcurrent protection device"); see (Tristar PWM) controller manual
* using 4x 150W exceeds largest SunSaver controller capacity (33A > 20A), options:
  - switch to 24Vdc base voltage
    . need to replace valves with 24V or get 24->12 transformer
    . need to replace pump with 24V or get 24-12 transformer
  - use (2) charge controllers with (1) battery bank (2*$80)
    . each controller needs to be 20A (8A per 150W panel)
    . load only from one controller
  - create two parallel systems
    . essentially the same as using 2 controllers with 1 battery bank
    . only real difference is seperate battery banks
    . possibly also use 10A instead of 20A charge controller for datalogger/sensor system
    . more hassle than using 2 controllers with 1 battery bank
  - use TriStar 45A PWM controller ($170) <-- ***currently considered best option***
    . accepts much higher solar voltage input, allowing series connections across panels
    . however, charge efficiency decreases with increased input voltages
    . serial data output <- port-powered!
  - use TriStar 45A MPPT controller ($410)
    . increased charge efficiency over PWM, especially at lower temperatures & higher power consumption
    . if this system is destined for California, temp-related benefits are probably void
    . serial data output <- probably also port-powered!
