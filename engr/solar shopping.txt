power requirements
------------------

Estimated system use of 74W
Pullman area is rated 4hr/day full sun exposure so need 74W*(24/4) ~= 444W daily input
    444W = 3.2 @ 140W, 3.0 @ 150W, 1.6 @ 275W, 1.5 @ 300W

  *** using multiple 140W+ panels results in exceeding Amp capacity of current (10A) solar controller! see options below

solar panel cable, qty 1
  - must be sufficiently long to cover double the distance; will cut cable in halff
  - 50' extension cable; 10 AWG; p/n 9994165; $45
  - 100' extension cable; 10 AWG; p/n 9991054; $80
  * may need to increase wire gage significantly (possibly 2 or 1/0 AWG); see (Tristar PWM) controller manual
  * alternately, connect panels locally & run THHN or similar wire (think Romex)

solar panel cable Y-connector, qty (1 each)*(# panels - 1) --> 2 ea?
  - MC4 branch connector, 2 male -> 1 female; p/n 9999404; $21
  - MC4 branch connector, 2 female -> 1 male; p/n 9999403; $21

copper grounding wire (Home Depot)
  - Cerrowire 25ft 6/1 solid bare copper grounding wire; $19.97
  - Southwire 6 solid bare copper; $0.89/ft

some notes
----------
* charge controller must be protected from inductive loads
  - power pump from battery bank using relay on load side
  - place very large flyback diode across load terminals
* may need a breaker ("overcurrent protection device"); see (Tristar PWM) controller manual
* using 4x 150W exceeds largest SunSaver controller capacity (33A > 20A), options:
  - use TriStar 45A PWM controller ($170) <-- ***currently considered best option***
    . accepts much higher solar voltage input, allowing series connections across panels
    . however, charge efficiency decreases with increased input voltages
    . serial data output <- port-powered!
  - use TriStar 45A MPPT controller ($410)
    . increased charge efficiency over PWM, especially at lower temperatures & higher power consumption
    . if this system is destined for California, temp-related benefits are probably void
    . serial data output <- probably also port-powered!
